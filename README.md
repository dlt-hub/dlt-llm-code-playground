# dltHub LLM Code Playground

### How this playground example works

In this example, you will create a `dlt` pipeline for a data source of your choice.

### What is happening right now

An extension called Continue is load over the next 30-90 seconds while you are reading this.

When it has finished, it will install a GUI, which you can access by clicking the square on the left side of the codespace.

### What you will need to do

You will need to provide an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which will only be revealed to and used by you. If you do not have one, you can still try it out.

As the playground example runs, you will review the actions taken and step-by-step explainations. Additional context can be found [here](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/create-a-pipeline).

At certain points, it will pause and ask you to take actions. Follow the instructions or reply to the question to continue moving forward.
