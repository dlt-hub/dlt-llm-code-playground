# dltHub LLM Code Playground

## How this playground example works

In this example, you will set up a verified source pipeline to run in Airflow.

## What is happening right now

An extension called Continue is loading over the next 30-90 seconds while you are reading this.

When it has finished, it will open a panel with a GUI on the right side of the codespace.

## What you will need to do

You will need to provide an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which will only be revealed to and used by you.

As the playground example runs, you will review the actions taken and step-by-step explainations. Additional context can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/dlthub/Deploy-a-pipeline-with-Airflow-245fd1058652479494307ead0b5565f3).

At certain points, it will pause and ask you to take actions. Follow the instructions or reply to the question to continue moving forward.
