# dltHub LLM Code Playground

## How this playground example works

**CUSTOMIZE**

## What is happening right now

An extension called `Continue` is loading over the next 30-60 seconds while you are reading this.

When it has finished, it will open a panel with a GUI on the right side of the codespace.

## What you will need to do

You will need to provide an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which will only be revealed and used here by you.

As the playground example runs, it will explain to you what is happening step-by-step. Please read [these docs](**CUSTOMIZE**) if anything is unclear.

At certain points, it will pause and ask you to take actions. Follow the instructions or reply to the question to continue moving forward.
